# Mobile-Controlled-RC-Robot

I Developed a Remote Controlled car (RC) with dedicated PCB and controlled it from custom built mobile application that could be used for surveillance.
•	Designed the PCB in eagle and incorporated micro controller (ATmega 328), crystal oscillator, resistors and capacitors into the PCB.
•	Developed the mobile application in MIT App inventor 2 and incorporated Bluetooth module to enable the user to control the robot and move it in particular directions up to a range of 15m.
•	Achieved a precision rate of 30% more in control and cost efficiency of 40% when compared to IR based products available in market.
